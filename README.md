## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git

Install dependencies:
npm install

Run locally:
npm run dev

If this fails, the issue is your setup — not the framework.

---

## 🧠 Customization

- Update personal content in /src/data
- Replace images in /public/assets
- Adjust theme colors in /src/styles
- Remove sections that don’t serve a purpose

Rule:
If a section doesn’t help you get hired, paid, or trusted — delete it.

---

## 📈 Deployment

Deployed using Vercel.

Build:
npm run build

Deploy:
vercel deploy

If it’s not live, it doesn’t exist.

- GitHub: https://github.com/your-username

Make it easy to contact you or stop complaining about silence.
